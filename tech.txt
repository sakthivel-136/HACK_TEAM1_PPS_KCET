### üîç **Problem Statement: Tech Gadget Purchase Prediction Using Logistic Regression**

Many technology companies face challenges in accurately identifying potential buyers for newly launched gadgets. Understanding customer behavior and preferences is critical to optimizing marketing efforts and maximizing product reach.

The objective of this project is to **build a binary classification model using logistic regression** to predict whether a person is likely to buy a newly launched tech gadget.

The model will be trained on a dataset containing individual-level data with the following features:

* **Age Group** (Ordinal categorical)
* **Interest in Technology** (Scale: 1 = Not interested, 5 = Very interested)
* **Past Purchase Behavior** (Ordinal categorical)
* **Monthly Income** (Numeric, normalized)
* **Social Media Engagement with Tech Content** (Scale: 1 = Not engaged, 5 = Very engaged)

The target variable:

* **Will Buy**:

  * `1` = Likely to buy
  * `0` = Not likely to buy

The solution involves:

* Preprocessing the dataset (encoding categorical variables and normalizing numeric ones)
* Training a **logistic regression model**
* Evaluating the model using accuracy and confusion matrix
* Optionally, building a user interface to simulate predictions based on user input
